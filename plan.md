- [ ] error when parrot is missing required specific args - the message could say how to fix it - the AI will do it automagically
  - this means one workflow is to start with the `with parrot(fn):` - the error message / hook will guide the agent in the right direction
  - we could try to find the existing `verify_parrot(fn)` and suggest an edit, if we don't find it we could suggest to add it from scratch
- [ ] omg hooks! if I have a hook I can run my local agent with this information
- [ ] slidev per concept
- [ ] hooks can be shell cmds, or python functions
  - shell cmds are cross-language/stack
  - the temp logs can be implemented by hooks - which means they can be implemented once
- [ ] parrot + executable command
- [ ] approvals.rc / `.approvals/hooks/mismatch`

- [x] serialize/deserialize function calls
- [x] **AND** allow human-readable printers too
- [x] review original example using parrots to understand it better
